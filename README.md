# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer
in this project i will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. i will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum. The data visualizations will help understanding the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
